</Row>

```sql weekly_trends
select 
  date_trunc('week', dep_time) as week,
  cancellation_rate,
  diversion_rate,
  avg(dep_delay) as avg_dep_delay,
  avg(arr_delay) as avg_arr_delay,
  on_time_departure_rate,
  on_time_arrival_rate,
  count(*) as flight_count,
  avg(distance) as avg_distance
from flights
group by 1
order by 1 asc
```

## Trends over time

<Row>
  <LineChart title="Flight volume vs. average distance" 
    subtitle="Trending to more, shorter distance flights" 
    data="weekly_trends" 
    x="week" 
    y="flight_count" 
    y2="avg_distance" 
  />
  <LineChart title="Cancellation rate" 
    subtitle="9/11 is clearly shown with a spike in cancellations" 
    data="weekly_trends" 
    x="week" 
    y="cancellation_rate" 
    yFmt="pct1" 
  />
</Row>

## Carrier Comparison

```sql carrier_performance
select 
  carriers.name as carrier_name,
  count(*) as flight_count,
  on_time_departure_rate,
  1 - on_time_departure_rate as delayed_departure_rate,
  on_time_arrival_rate,
  1 - on_time_arrival_rate as delayed_arrival_rate,
  cancellation_rate,
  avg(dep_delay) as avg_departure_delay,
  avg(arr_delay) as avg_arrival_delay
from flights 
group by 1
order by 2 desc
```

<Row>
  <BarChart title="Average Departure Delay by Carrier (minutes)"
