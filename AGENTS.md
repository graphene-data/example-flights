# RULES
- Graphene contains languages and tools that you do not already know, so IT IS CRITICAL that you read the Graphene documentation (@/node_modules/@graphenedata/cli/dist/docs/graphene.md) **in its entirety** before working in this project. You will be docked every time you write code here without first reading the documentation.

# About the data
_Flights_ is a database containing FAA flight data from 2000-2005. All the tables are inside the /tables directory.
