# example-flights
A Graphene project analyzing FAA flights data from 2000-2005.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo
2. `npm install @graphenedata/cli`
3. `npm run setup`

## Try Graphene

Ask your agent to come up with an interesting question about this data, and then build a dashboard answering it. Your agent will create a Graphene .md which is viewable at `localhost:4000/<markdown-file-path-without-extension>`.

Comprehensive documentation is available at `node_modules/@graphenedata/cli/dist/docs/graphene.md`.
